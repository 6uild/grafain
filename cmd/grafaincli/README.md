# `grafaincli`

`grafaincli` provides a set of commands to create, modify and submit messages. Each
command provides a minimal set functionality. Commands are intended to be
combined into pipelines using UNIX pipes.

## Command information

To get the list of all available command, type `grafaincli`. Each command provides
further explanation. Use `-help` flag to learn more about each command.

    $ grafaincli submit -help
    Read binary serialized transaction from standard input and submit it.

    Make sure to collect enough signatures before submitting the transaction.
    -tm string
        Tendermint node address. Use proper NETWORK name. You can use
        GRAFAINCLI_TM_ADDR environment variable to set it. (default
        "https://grafain.NETWORK.iov.one:443")

## Combine commands using UNIX pipe

Each command provides a small portion of functionality expected by any
workflow. Combine them using UNIX pipes to create a powerful pipelines.

## Cookbook

For example usage of commands as well as pipelines, see
[`clitests/`](clitests/) directory. Files with extension `.test` contains short
code snippets.

Notice that all pipelines end with `grafaincli view`. This displays the
transaction. To submit it, after the transaction is prepared, sign it and
submit it. This is done by piping the transaction to `grafaincli`:

```
<build tx with grafaincli> | grafaincli sign | grafaincli submit
```

To sign and submit you must provide the signature key and set tendermint
adderess. Both can be set via environment variables `GRAFAINCLI_PRIV_KEY` and
`GRAFAINCLI_TM_ADDR`.
